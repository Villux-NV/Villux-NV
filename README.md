- 👋 Hi, I’m @Villux-NV
- 👀 I’m interested in creating projects that I enjoy using, learning new tech to put into my projects, and cookies!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything that comes across my path. I jump around a lot so jack of all trades, masters of none.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something neat and if you think we would click! 
- 📫 How to reach me... here I suppose.
